                <h2>Ciao, I'm <b>Neeraj.</b></h2><br/>
                Lately, I've been hanging out with the cool kids in the Recommendations and Discovery squad at Disney+ Hotstar. But before that, I was the web wizard in the Web Engineering team. <br /> <br />
                
                Back in my student days at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Vadodara, where I (supposedly) learnt Computer Science. I even did some undercover internship work at MathWorks during my summer and spring breaks. <br /> <br />
                
                Now, what tickles my fancy? I'm all about the wild worlds of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, and Web Engineering too. Orthogonal? I know :P <br/>
